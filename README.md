# BigRedRecruitment

This is a TAFE assignment where we had to create a C# Window program to manage 2 classes of objects. We had to be able to create remove and assign objects of different classes in a functional Window program. 
This is the first project we had for C# using Classes and Objects as well as creating a UI for a program outside of a console-based program.
